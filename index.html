        <h2>Become a Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>
          A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software
          engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer
          software. The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may
          also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.
